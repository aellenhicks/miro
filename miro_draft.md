# Summary 
This document contains the Minimal Information for Reporting of an Ontology (MIRO) guidelines. 

# Guidelines

## Basics

### Ontology name

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The full name of the ontology, including the acronym and the version number referred to in the report. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Gene Ontology (GO), v2.13; Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology (FMA), v4.22; |
----

### Ontology owner

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The names and affiliations of the ontology owner and/or editors. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Robert Stevens, University of Manchester is the owner and principal editor of the FHKB. |
----

### Ontology license

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The licence under which the ontology is available. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY 3.0) |
----

### Ontology URL

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The location where the ontology file is available. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies/doid.owl |
----

### Ontology repository

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The repository that is used to manage the different versions of the ontology. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | https://github.com/geneontology |
----

### Methodological framework

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | A prescribed ontology engineering methodology if used. |
| **Importance:** | OPTIONAL |
| **Example:** | OntoClean, Methontology |
----

## Motivation

### Need

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | Details on why the ontology is needed. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Description outlining the need, including examples of gaps in, for example, competency question form. |
----

### Competition

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | If there is another ontology in the area, description on why the one being reported is needed instead/in addition. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Justification as to why a competing ontology does not satisfy requirements. |
----

### Target audience

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** |The target audience; who, what, where, when. Was the ontology developed specifically for use in an application or to accurately describe a specific domain of interest? |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Description of the audience. |
----

## Scope, Requirements, Community

### Scope and coverage

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | Scope of the ontology including name of domain, granularity of representation and coverage extent. A high level (diagrammatic) visualisation is optional, but often helpful to illustrate the scope. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | This ontology represents a classification of infectious human diseases. It excludes related information such as organismal systems they affect. |
----

### Community

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | The community that is being engaged and how it is being done. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | Description of use scenarios gathered and competency questions, any consultations held, size of engagement. |
----

### Email list and issue tracking

|  | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Description:** | Location of the email list and/or the issue tracking systems used for development and managing feature requests. |
| **Importance:** | MUST |
| **Example:** | http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/submit.html |
